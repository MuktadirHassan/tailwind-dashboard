FlexBox resources:

https://codepen.io/dfederighi/pen/wXBEaZ

Findings: 
FlexBox seems like to be better than css variable.cause: - css variable is complex to modify once it build. - I mean reusability is less. - But for fixed component it may be better.
FlexBox also have some issue I think,- FlexBox is less customable we can just use the skeleton of flex.- and the good portion is easy to partitioning But I do prefer tailwind css as we discuss earlier morning.So, you may have a look at the sudo code and after your confirmation I will proceed with tailwind css.

construct with flex > flex wrap

body
    -aside(sidebar)
        -block
            -ul
                -li
    -main
        -nav
        -div
            -flex, flex-wrap(cards)

pros:
a lots of customable classes that will help you to control easily.
cons:
it difficult to remember all the class at a time.



CoreUI resources:

        -ul

    -main

        -main
            -card(using flex)


sidebar uses as hide and show condition.
pros:
For any fixed kind of dashboard it will be fine
cons:
for any customable dashboard it will be not better because it depends on css variables and changes any of css variable for every single item is little be complex and time consuming.
