Findings: 
FlexBox seems like to be better than css variable.cause: - css variable is complex to modify once it build. - I mean reusability is less. - But for fixed component it may be better.
FlexBox also have some issue I think,- FlexBox is less customable we can just use the skeleton of flex.- and the good portion is easy to partitioning But I do prefer tailwind css as we discuss earlier morning.So, you may have a look at the sudo code and after your confirmation I will proceed with tailwind css.
